## Executive Summary

### 🎯 The Core Finding

**56% of paid users never use the product.** We have 7.0 users per account on average, but only 3.1 are active. That's 3.9 dormant users per account - totaling ~4,785 idle users across the customer base.

**The opportunity:** Activate dormant users to drive retention and revenue growth without requiring new customer acquisition.

## Insight #1: User Adoption Reality

### ⚡ KEY TAKEAWAY

Sales lands 7 seats per account, but Product only activates 3 users. The gap between "account adoption" (53.7% use Field Crew) and "TRUE user adoption" (31.2% of all users) reveals we're measuring success incorrectly.

### The Seat Sprawl Problem

**Problem:** Sales lands accounts with 7 seats, but Product only activates 3 users. The other 4 sit dormant.

| Metric                 | Value | Implication              |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| Total Users (CRM)      | 8,589 | Paid seats               |
| Active Users (WAU)     | 3,785 | 44% activation rate      |
| Dormant Users          | 4,804 | 56% never log in         |
| Avg Users per Account  | 7.0   | Sales lands well         |
| Avg Active per Account | 3.1   | Product activates poorly |

### Account vs User Adoption Gap

When we say "53.7% of accounts use Field Crew," we mean 53.7% have **at least 1 user** using it. But the TRUE user adoption (active users ÷ total users) tells a different story:

| Feature    | Account Adoption | TRUE User Adoption | Gap     |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| Field Crew | 53.7%            | 31.2%              | -22.5pp |
| Contacts   | 71.0%            | 42.9%              | -28.1pp |
| Invoices   | 68.7%            | 41.3%              | -27.4pp |
| Estimates  | 61.5%            | 35.4%              | -26.1pp |

**Implication:** Product and CS teams need to track BOTH metrics. Account adoption shows market penetration. User adoption shows actual usage depth.

## Insight #2: Retention Correlation

### ⚡ KEY TAKEAWAY

Full Team accounts (75%+ adoption) retain 15.2pp better than Power User accounts (<25%) at Week 26. But don't judge early - Week 1 metrics look WORSE due to onboarding friction. The benefit shows at 6 months.

### Full Team Adoption Drives Retention

**Finding:** Accounts with 75%+ user adoption (Full Team) retain 15.2 percentage points better than accounts with <25% adoption (Power Users) at Week 26.

| Adoption Tier          | Accounts | Week 1 | Week 12 | Week 26 | Week 52 |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Power Users (<25%)** | 456      | 86.9%  | 86.2%   | 77.6%   | 73.2%   |
| **Partial (25-50%)**   | 539      | 85.4%  | 83.9%   | 86.0%   | 81.7%   |
| **Majority (50-75%)**  | 158      | 82.9%  | 82.9%   | 87.3%   | 84.8%   |
| **Full Team (75%+)**   | 59       | 79.3%  | 95.5%   | 92.8%   | 92.8%   |

### Key Observations

- **Week 1 Paradox:** Full Team accounts have LOWER retention (79.3%) than Power Users (86.9%) at Week 1. This is expected - onboarding more users creates more initial friction.
- **Week 12 Flip:** By Week 12, Full Team retention jumps to 95.5% while Power Users drop to 86.2%. The investment in team onboarding pays off.
- **Week 26 Benefit:** Full Team retains at 92.8% vs Power Users at 77.6%. That's a **+15.2pp lift**.
- **Week 52 Compound:** Full Team maintains 92.8% while Power Users drop to 73.2%. That's a **+19.6pp lift** over the year.

    style PU4 fill:#d73a49,color:#fff
```

### ⚠️ Critical Implication

**Don't judge user activation success by Week 1 or Week 4 metrics.** The retention benefit doesn't show up until 6 months in (Week 26). Early metrics will look WORSE because you're onboarding more users.

## Insight #4: Revenue Opportunity

### ⚡ KEY TAKEAWAY

539 Partial accounts (44.5% of total) represent the best target. Moving just 15% of them (81 accounts) to higher tiers saves $119k ARR annually, $825k over 5 years - 3.0x ROI on $275k investment.

### 539 Partial Accounts = $119k ARR Opportunity

We segmented the 1,212 accounts into 4 tiers based on TRUE user adoption rates. **The Partial tier (25-50% adoption) represents the biggest opportunity.**

| Tier                 | Accounts | % of Total | Avg Users | Avg Active | Week 26 Retention |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Power Users (<25%)   | 456      | 37.6%      | 7.2       | 1.5        | 77.6%             |
| **Partial (25-50%)** | **539**  | **44.5%**  | **7.1**   | **2.7**    | **86.0%**         |
| Majority (50-75%)    | 158      | 13.0%      | 6.4       | 4.0        | 87.3%             |
| Full Team (75%+)     | 59       | 4.9%       | 6.5       | 5.5        | 92.8%             |

    "Full Team (75%+)" : 59
```

### Conservative Revenue Scenario

**Goal:** Move 15% of Partial accounts (81 accounts) to Majority tier within 12 months

| Metric                     | Value                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

| Retention improvement      | +8.4pp (Partial 86.0% → Full Team 92.8%) |
| Average account ARR        | $2,200                                   |
| **Annual ARR saved**       | **$119,000**                             |

## Insight #6: Execution Recommendations

### ⚡ KEY TAKEAWAY

Q1 2026: Launch 3 initiatives in parallel - Invoices approval workflows (8 weeks), user activation analytics (4 weeks), dormant user campaign (4 weeks). Judge success at Week 26 (Q3 2026), not Week 1.

### Q1 2026 Priorities

#### 1. Launch Invoices Approval Workflows (8 weeks, $50k)

**Why:** Invoices has the highest adoption lift (+20.4pp). Approval workflows are the #1 team collaboration feature.

**Features:**

- Multi-level approval chains (field → admin → accountant)
- Email + in-app notifications
- Approval history & audit trail
- Conditional routing by amount/customer

#### 2. Build User Activation Analytics (4 weeks, $20k)

**Why:** CS needs to identify dormant users within healthy accounts.

**Deliverables:**

- Dashboard showing TRUE user adoption % per account
- Alerts for accounts with 3+ dormant users
- Segmentation by tier (Power Users, Partial, Majority, Full Team)
- User activation trend tracking

#### 3. Create Dormant User Activation Campaign (4 weeks, $20k)

**Why:** 56% of users never log in. We need automated re-engagement.

**Campaign:**

- Week 1 - "Your team is using Method - join them" (peer pressure)
- Week 2 - "See what [teammate] is doing in Invoices" (social proof)
- Week 3 - Admin prompt to invite dormant users
- Week 4 - CS outreach for never-logged-in users

### Success Metrics (Judge at 6 Months, Not Week 1)

| Metric                           | Baseline | Target (Q3 2026)  |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Avg active users per account     | 3.1      | 4.2 (+35%)        |
| Dormant users per account        | 3.9      | 2.8 (-28%)        |
| Partial accounts → Majority      | 0        | 81 accounts (15%) |
| Week 26 retention (Partial tier) | 86.0%    | 87.3% (+1.3pp)    |
| ARR saved                        | $0       | $119k/year        |

### ⚠️ Critical: Don't Judge Too Early

Full team adoption takes 6 months to show retention benefits. **Week 1 metrics will look WORSE** (more onboarding friction, more support tickets, lower initial retention). The payoff comes at Week 26.

**Judge success in Q3 2026, not Q1.**

---

## Insight #7: Strategic Decision for 2026

### ⚡ KEY TAKEAWAY

Choose ACTIVATION over acquisition. We already have 4,785 dormant users. No sales team required - just better product + CS execution. This is 2026's strategic bet.

**The Question:** Should we optimize for acquisition (more accounts) or activation (more users per account)?

**The Answer: ACTIVATION**

**Why:** Sales already landed accounts with 7 seats, but Product only activates 3 users. We have 4,785 dormant users across the customer base. No sales team required - just better product + CS. Delivers +15.2pp retention lift at Week 26 and 3.0x ROI over 5 years.

### What We're Missing

- **Mobile usage data** - Field Crew adoption likely under-reported
- **Vertical-level retention** - Do Construction accounts retain better than HVAC?
- **Churn reasons** - Why do users go dormant? (requires interviews)
- **Competitive analysis** - How does Method compare to competitors?
- **App pack revenue data** - Which packs drive MRR growth?

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Socialize findings** with Product, CS, Sales, and Executive leadership
2. **Validate assumptions** - Does $2.2k avg ARR match finance data?
3. **Prioritize Q1 roadmap** - Lock in Invoices approval workflows
4. **Brief CS team** - Shift metrics from account health → user activation depth
5. **User interviews** - Talk to 20-30 dormant users to understand why they stopped

### Q1 2026 Deliverables

- **Product:** Invoices approval workflows (8 weeks, $50k)
- **Product:** Shared invoice templates (6 weeks, $40k)
- **Analytics:** User activation dashboard (4 weeks, $20k)
- **CS:** Dormant user activation campaign (4 weeks, $20k)
- **CS:** Training on new playbooks (2 weeks, $10k)

```

- **Team features increase complexity** - More support burden, slower onboarding
- **Dormant users don't want the product** - They were added by admin but never needed it
- **Retention lift doesn't materialize** - Correlation isn't causation
- **Investment exceeds $275k** - Scope creep on approval workflows
- **CS bandwidth** - 539 Partial accounts is a lot to manage

## Conclusion

The data reveals a clear opportunity: **56% of paid users never use the product**. That's 4,785 dormant users across 1,227 accounts. Sales already landed the seats. Product just needs to activate them.

### The path forward is clear:

```

- **Focus:** User activation over new acquisition
- **Target:** 539 Partial accounts (25-50% adoption)
- **Investment:** $275k in Invoices, Estimates, and CS playbooks
- **Return:** $119k ARR/year, 3.0x ROI over 5 years
- **Timeline:** Judge success at Week 26 (Q3 2026), not Week 1

**The strategic bet for 2026: Activate the users we already sold.**
