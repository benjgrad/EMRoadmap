# ARR and Customization Analysis Report

## 1. Current Business Snapshot

- **Active Accounts:** 3,865
- **Current ARR:** $5,556,729
- **Average Revenue per Account (ARPA):** $119.81/month
- **Current MRR:** ≈ $463,061/month

This reflects a strong recurring base, but heavily weighted toward low ARPA customers.

---

## 2. Acquisition and Conversion Dynamics (Last 2 Years)

- **Average Monthly Trials:** ~860
- **Average Monthly Conversions:** ~96
- **Trial → Paid Conversion Rate:** 11.2%
- **Churn Rate:** 4.0% (≈ 0.3% monthly)
- **Average Active Duration (implied):** 30+ months

**Interpretation:** You are converting roughly one in ten trials into paying customers, and your churn performance is strong once converted.

---

## 3. Customization and Scalability

- **79.4% of Active Accounts** have **Custom Screens (New or Classic)**.
- This is a major scalability bottleneck, suggesting that most customers require implementation or customization to realize value.
- This limits the efficiency of onboarding, upgrades, and self-serve product-led growth.

## 4. Growth Path to $100M ARR

At current dynamics:

- **ARR Growth:** ≈ +$1.7M per year (from 96 new accounts/month × ARPA × 12)
- **Projected Time to $100M:** ~55 years (without pricing or conversion changes)

To reach **$100M ARR in 5 years**, you'd need combinations such as:

| Lever           | Current | Target |
| --------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Monthly Trials  | 860     | 8,500+ |
| Conversion Rate | 11%     | 20–25% |
| ARPA            | $120    | $600   |
| % Customized    | 79%     | <30%   |

## 5. Strategic Insights and Recommendations

### A. Shift from Custom to Standardized Workflows

- Introduce "Workflow Kits" for the top 3–5 use cases (e.g. dispatching, invoicing, field visits)
- Limit full custom builds to high-tier customers only
- Incentivize standard workflow adoption with faster setup and better pricing

### B. Invest in No-Code Extensibility, Not Forks

- Build re-usable **UI components**, **action templates**, and **debugging tools** in your no-code platform
- Define "approved extension points" so customers can personalize without forking

### C. Improve Trial Conversion Efficiency

- Streamline onboarding around the most common workflows (not the fully flexible builder)
- Add guided setup, templates, and usage-based incentives

### D. Strengthen ARPA Through Value Expansion

- Offer advanced workflow bundles, reporting, and analytics as paid add-ons
- Revisit pricing to charge by **value drivers** (technicians, workflows, active jobs, etc.) rather than seats alone

### E. Plan for Platform Health Metrics

Track and report monthly:

- % Accounts using standard workflows
- % Accounts with custom forks
- Avg time to onboarding
- Avg # of custom screens per account
- ARR growth by workflow category

## 6. Summary

Your current ARR foundation is solid but heavily constrained by customization complexity.

To realistically move toward $100M ARR, the company must:

1. Standardize core workflows to scale faster
2. Reduce customization overhead
3. Improve ARPA and conversion through standardized experiences
4. Evolve the no-code platform to support configuration over customization

This balance between flexibility and scale will define the company's growth trajectory for the next 3–5 years.
