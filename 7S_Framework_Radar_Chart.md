## Assessment Notes

Based on your comprehensive organizational analysis, these scores reflect:

- **Staff (8/10)**: Your analysis shows "Highly skilled individual contributors across all teams"
- **Skills (7/10)**: "Strong technical skills" with room for process skills improvement
- **Shared Values (5/10)**: Cultural conflicts between "Quality vs. speed, innovation vs. stability"
- **Strategy (3/10)**: "Technical strategy inconsistent across teams"
- **Structure (4/10)**: "Unclear technical decision hierarchy"
- **Systems (2/10)**: "Multiple disconnected systems and processes"
- **Style (4/10)**: "Collaborative but indecisive on technical matters"

This visualization supports your key finding that Method has "exceptional individual technical competency" operating within "systemic patterns that inhibit sustainable value delivery."
